MegaTrawls Network Matrices HCP


Notes
-----
Network Matrices data of two types, Full correlation and Partial correlation
matrices estimated by a timeseries signals extracted from a nodes of Group ICA
parcellations. In total, 461 functional connectivity datasets were used.

Data is available for all dimensionalities (d=25, d=50, d=100, d=200, d=300)
of Group ICA and for all timeseries methods multiple spatial regression and
eigen regression (ts2 and ts3).

These matrices can be used to predict the relationships between subjects
functional connectivity and subjects behavioural measures.
